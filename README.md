# Electrolyte Correction Calculator
## Motivation
>In Medicine, correcting electrolyte imbalance due to various causes most commonly due to excessive vomitting and diarrhea remains a big challenge among doctors. This often requires a long and easy to forget mathematical calculation. With this app, my aim is to automate this process so that health care practitioners can spend less time doing uncomfortable calculations and more time saving lives.
