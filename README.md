# Project Title: 
Electrolyte Correction Calculator

### Motivation
>In Medicine, correcting electrolyte imbalance due to various causes most commonly, excessive vomitting and diarrhea remains a challenge as this often requires a long and easy to forget mathematical calculation. With this app, my aim is to automate this process to allow health care practitioners spend less time doing uncomfortable calculations and more time saving lives.
